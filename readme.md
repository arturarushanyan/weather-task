# Weather App with pure JS, HTML and CSS

The app is for getting a forecast for selected city. On initial load app will ask for allowing geolocation permissions. Please allow in order for using the app properly.
In case of now allowing geolocation. Berlin will be selected as a default city.
The app is written using Javascript, html and css. However, I've setted up just a basic express server for running it.
